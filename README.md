-   `youtube-fullerscreen/`  
    [Install here](/youtube-fullerscreen/youtube-fullerscreen.user.js)
    — Re-enable YouTube fullscreen scroll feature.  
    This
    script removes the `deprecate-fullerscreen-ui` attribute so the browser's
    fullscreen scroll-to-seek behaviour is restored on watch pages.  
    Note: YouTube has marked this feature as deprecated; if YouTube disables it the
    userscript may stop working.

Install

Click the "Install here" links in the index to install a script  
install a
userscript manager first (recommended: Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, or
Greasemonkey).
